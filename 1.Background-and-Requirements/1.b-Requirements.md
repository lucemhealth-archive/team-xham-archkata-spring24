# Requirements

Alerting
- Push notifications are sent to a mobile app and consolidated
monitoring screen
- Based on whether the patient is awake or asleep,
alert thresholds will be different

Consolidated monitoring screen
- View the vitals for a given patient updated within a second
of the recording

Vital sign historical view
- Filter by vital sign and time range for all records within
the past 24 hours

Snapshot capture
- Can capture a patient's vital signs at a given moment and send
it to MyMedicalData

## Context

- The company launching MonitorMe supports 2 existing cloud-based SAAS products,
so they should be very familiar with cloud tooling 
- The company expects a lot of change as they bring this to market (think about
deployment)
- Patient confidentiality is important
- Vital sign data must be as accurate as possible
- Need the flexibility to add more vital sign monitoring devices


## Non-functional requirements:

Fault-tolerance
- When vital sign capture fails, other vital signs succeed

Flexibility
- Able to add more vitals

Security
- Patient confidentiality

Latency
- 1 second to monitoring screen

Configurability
- Which 20 patients on each monitoring screen

Availability - 99.99%
- Dealing with patient vital information

Elasticity - low overall in the system but
- Alerting feature has to be elastic (20 patients versus 500 patients firing alerts)
