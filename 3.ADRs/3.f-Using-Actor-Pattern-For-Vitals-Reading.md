# Using Actor Pattern For Device Reading

Status: Accepted

# Context

Device Reader needs to communicate with devices that are producing
vitals data to the MonitorMe platform.  These devices send data at 
different cadences and each devices data needs to present on a Nurses 
Monitoring Workstation in 1 second or less from when the device sent the data. 

# Decision

Seperating device data consumption and production vitals to a Nurses Monitoring
Workstation in a soft realtime fashion lends it's to using the Erlang/Elixir based 
Actor pattern.  Using the Erlang/Elixir and it's battle proven platform will
provide soft real time, scalable, fault-tolerant behaviors to the Device Reading
System.

The soft real time that Erlang/Elixir provides through asynchronous message passing via actors
will provided the less than 1 second latency to the Nurses Monitoring Workstation.

The scalability of an Erlang/Elixir application will handle the device load put on the Device 
Reading System as the Erlang/Elixir platform is a proven and battle tested platform in
regards to scalability.

By using the actor pattern the devices will be isolated and can fail without effecting other 
devices connected to the Device Reading System. The Erlang/Elixir actor Supervision can be used to 
restart device connection and reading automatically which creates a fault tolerant system.


# Consequences

Erlang/Elixir is not a widely used language and platform when compared to other languages such
as Java.
