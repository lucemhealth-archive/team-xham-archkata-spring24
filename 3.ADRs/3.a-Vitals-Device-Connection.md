# Using the TCP protocol for Device Connection

Status: Accepted

## Context

The MonitorMe platform needs to read vitals data from devices and send the vitals data
to Nurses Monitoring Stations in 1 second or less. The vitals data cannot be incomplete
or corrupted due to packet loss.

## Decision

TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication. It ensures that data is delivered 
in the correct order and without errors by employing mechanisms such as sequence numbers, 
acknowledgments, and retransmissions. If a packet is lost or damaged during transmission, 
TCP will retransmit it until it is successfully received by the recipient. 
This reliability makes TCP ideal for applications where data integrity and completeness are critical

TCP implements flow control mechanisms to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. 
Through the use of sliding window protocols, TCP dynamically adjusts the rate of data transmission 
based on the receiver's buffer space and processing capabilities. This helps optimize network performance 
and prevents packet loss due to buffer overflow. Flow control is particularly beneficial for applications 
that involve data transfer over networks with varying bandwidth or latency.

## Consequences

TCP will ensure vitals data will reach the Vitals Reader in the correct order and displayed and stored
correctly on the Nurses Monitoring Station and Vitals Database
