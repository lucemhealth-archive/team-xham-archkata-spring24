# Create vitals analyzer as a stream with a cache

Status: Superseded

## Context

Vitals Analyzer needs to make decisions about when to alert based on the vitals
it receives from the Vitals Reader. At the same time, we know that the Vitals
Analyzer would be deployed with multiple instances to handle the load of
analyzing the vitals. That means that for a given patient, the vitals could go
to different instances. We need to ensure that a given instance while analyzing a
given patient has all the context to make a decision about when to alert.

## Decision

We will create the Vitals Analyzer as a service that receives a TCP stream of
vitals from the Vitals Reader. The Vitals Analyzer will then save the vitals to a
cache. The cache would be a distributed cache that is shared between all the
instances of the Vitals Analyzer. The Vitals Analyzer will then analyze the
vitals from the cache and make decisions about when to alert. The Vitals Analyzer
should only alert if it received the final vital to make a decision about when to
alert. This will ensure that the Vitals Analyzer doesn't alert twice.

## Consequences

This decision will ensure that a given instance of the Vitals Analyzer will have
ownership over a given patient's vitals. It will also ensure that the Vitals
Analyzer has all the vitals data it needs to make a decision. The cache will
ensure that the Vitals Analyzer has all the vitals in the correct order.
