# Vitals Datastore

Document the architectural decision to place the vitals datastore in the vitals API container and moving the vitals query to the Vitals API as well.
Discuss the importance of having the Vitals API own the vitals datastore fully
Discuss why having the device reader write to the vitals datastore was important based on the architectural characteristics of the system

# Vitals datastore shared between the Device Reader and Vitals Query API

Status: Accepted

## Context

The Vitals Reader needs to quickly and reliably send data to the monitoring
screens, and we want high durability and quick availability of the vitals data
in the vitals query API.

## Decision

The Vitals Reader will write the vitals data to the vitals datastore. The Vitals
Query API will read the vitals data from the vitals datastore. This means that
the vitals datastore will be shared between the Vitals Reader and the Vitals
Query API.

## Consequences

This decision will ensure that the Vitals Query API has the vitals data it needs
to quickly and reliably send data to the monitoring screens. It will also ensure
that the vitals data is highly durable and quickly available in the Vitals Query
API. However, this decision is an anti-pattern because it couples the Vitals
Reader and the Vitals Query API. To mitigate this, we will ensure that the
Vitals Reader and Vitals Query API are deployed together.
