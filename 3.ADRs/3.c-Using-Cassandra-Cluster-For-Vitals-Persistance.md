# Using Cassandra for vitals persistance

Status: Accepted

## Context

Vitals Reader needs to store the vitals data for use by the Nurses Monitoring 
Snapshot Generation and Vitals Analyzer. A fast append only pattern was chosen
for the write-heavy nature that the Vitals Reader will need for storing vitals data.
The vitals data also has a TTL or Time to Live of 24 hours so the database used
needs to support TTL.

## Decision

Using a Cassandra cluster offers numerous benefits that make it a compelling choice for storing vitals. 
Firstly, Cassandra's distributed architecture provides high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring 
vitals data remains accessible even in the event of node failures or network issues. This resilience is 
crucial for the MonitorMe solution which requires continuous uptime and reliability. 
Additionally, Cassandra's linear scalability enables seamless expansion as vitals data grows, 
allowing you to add nodes to the cluster without downtime or performance degradation. Moreover, 
Cassandra's decentralized design eliminates single points of failure and bottlenecks, enhancing 
performance and throughput for read and write operations. Furthermore, Cassandra's flexible data model, 
based on a wide-column store, accommodates time-series data very well. Cassandra provides support 
for Time-To-Live (TTL) expiration on data at the individual column level. This feature is particularly useful 
for expiring vitals data after a 24 hour period.

## Consequences

We will have to manage the Cassandra Cluster which is more complex then a typical RDBMS database
