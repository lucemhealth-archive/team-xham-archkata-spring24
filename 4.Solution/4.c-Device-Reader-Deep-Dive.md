# Device Reader Deep Dive

The Device Reader is a critical component of the system. It is responsible for reading the vitals from the patient's monitor and sending them to the Vitals Analyzer. The Vitals Reader receives the vitals from the patient's monitor through a TCP connection. The Vitals Reader then sends the vitals to the Vitals Analyzer through a TCP connection. It also sends the vitals to the Vitals Datastore and to a Kafka topic that will be read by the Vitals Analyzer.

## Flexibility

The component diagram below shows that the Device Reader allows for pretty easy
addition of new device integrations. This allows any devices that can connect
with TCP and integrate with the Device Reader to be added to the system. This
flexbility is important because it allows the system to be able to integrate
with a wide variety of devices.
